# Rule of defining a variable in Python  
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names.

# 34age = 4 # Invalid because variable cannot start with a number
# a$$ge = 45 # Invlaid because variables cannot contain special characters other than _
