# Python supports several built-in data types:
#     Integers (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
#     Floats (float): Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
#     Strings (str): Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'Python').
#     Booleans (bool): Represents True or False.
#     Lists: Ordered, mutable collections (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
#     Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
#     Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
#     Dictionaries: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}).
