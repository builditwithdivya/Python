square = lambda x: x * x
'''As gooo as writing a function, but shorter and more concise.
   Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword.
   They can take any number of arguments but only have one expression.'''
sum = lambda a, b: a + b

print(square(5))  # This will print 25
print(sum(3, 4))  # This will print 7
